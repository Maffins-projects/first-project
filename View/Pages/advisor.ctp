Moving home is one of the most stressful events, and on average every one of us will move home 8 times in our lives. Preparation can go a long way to making the big move go much smoother than it otherwise might.
 <br />

   <p>
<b>Choose your movers wisely  </b>
<br />
When moving home it's always essential to pick the right removal company. Unless you have a good recommendation from a friend or family member of a removal company they have used, it may be like trying to pin the tail on the donkey. Do your research and don't be afraid to ask questions.
</p>
<p>
<b>Plan, plan and plan! </b>
<br />
Begin to plan for your house move early! Moving home is not something that you will do every day, so planning your house removal and choosing your removal company is key. Plan for your move as early as possible. Write check lists and keep track of things that need to be done.

 <b>How's the parking?</b>
 <br />
Check the parking situation at your old and new property well before the big day. Is there enough room to park a removal van? Will anyone need a permit? Can you arrange for neighbours to make room for you? 
 </p>
 <p>
<b>Don't forget protection! </b>
<br />
A great idea for protecting your mattresses is to put them inside an old duvet cover for protection. You can easily pop the cover in the washing machine later. Also, remember to remove the glass shelf from the bottom of your fridge and the glass dish from inside your microwave.

<b>Moving Office Top Tips </b>
<p>There is plenty to think about when you are moving office. Whether you're moving to a new premises nearby, relocating across the country or expanding your business nationwide, check out our top tips we hope will help with your moving day.
  </p>
<b>Get your budget right  </b>
<p>With any kind of business, budget is important. Depending on the size of your move, the removal cost can get expensive, so if you are on a tight budget, consider ways to keep the cost down; such as getting your employees to get involved with the packing. It can be fun!
    </p>
<b>Size is important!  </b>
<p>Although it may seem obvious, not all businesses will be moving to larger premises. Either way, make sure you take measurements of the new place and even draw up a floor plan so you can visualise where everything will fit. If your office movers are struggling for space on move day, you could find your staff working around boxes and appliances that could make your working environment hazardous.
    </p>
<b>Choose your movers wisely </b>
<p>When moving it's always essential to pick the right removal company. Unless you have a good recommendation from a friend, colleague or family member of a commercial removal company they have used, it may be like trying to pin the tail on the donkey. Do your research and don't be afraid to ask questions. One thing you need to consider as a business is whether you want the move to take place outside of office hours. Some companies will be happy to do your move after hours or on the weekend but you will need to know what the extra costs will be. 
  </p>
<b>Project management </b>
<p>Begin to plan for your office move early! Moving your business is not something that you will do every day, so planning your office move and choosing your removal company is key. Plan for your move as early as possible. Timing is so important, so try to work out the timings for each stage of the move. Remember, it's not just office furniture and filing cabinets. You may have to think about computer equipment, telephone lines and even your staff. Write check lists and keep track of things that need to be done.
